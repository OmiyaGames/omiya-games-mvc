**Mode-View-Controller (MVC)** is a common way of organizing code for GUI applications.  This package attempts to implement a version of this for Unity scripts.  Currently, this package is in development stages, and only the [Model](https://omiyagames.github.io/omiya-games-mvc/manual/model.html) part of the MVC has been created.
